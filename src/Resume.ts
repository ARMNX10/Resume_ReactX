# Projects & Activities

<h3 style="display: flex;justify-content: space-between;"> MATRIX AI Desktop Assistant <a style="font-size:1em" href="https://github.com/ARMNX10/M.A.T.R.I.X.">github.com/ARMNX10/M.A.T.R.I.X</a> </h3> 

- Developed a <b>voice-activated AI assistant</b> with 95% accuracy in natural language processing, capable of generating content, playing music, opening websites, launching applications, and using intents for dynamic, conversational interactions with users through random greetings.
- The AI assistant remains in passive listening mode and activates only upon detecting a specific wake-up voice command, then processes subsequent instructions.
- Built using <b>Python, nltk, Selenium, pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, Google Generative AI, HTML, CSS</b>, and <b>Javascript</b> to incorporate natural language processing, automation, and speech features, enabling smooth user interaction and task completion.

<h3 style="display: flex;justify-content: space-between;">MATRIX Parser<a style="font-size:1em" href="https://matrix-parser.github.io">matrix-parser.github.io</a> </h3> 

- Created a scalable solution that eliminates manual interpretation of structured data by providing a simple scripting interface. The system distinguishes between <b>different rows and columns in OCR results</b>, significantly reducing the time required to process large volumes of financial and business documents.
- This parser leverages <b>Google Cloud Vision</b> and <b>Python</b> to process data, then displays it in an editable interface. There is also a frontend where our scripting language can be used to extract data from a particular type of PDF, which can then be reused indefinitely for that specific document format.
<h3><a href="https://github.com/ARMNX10/Real-time-Braille-Conversion"></a></h3>
<h3 style="display: flex;justify-content: space-between;"> Real-Time Braille Converter <a style="font-size:1em" href="https://github.com/ARMNX10/Real-time-Braille-Conversion">github.com/ARMNX10/Real-time-Braille-Conversion</a> </h3> 

- Innovated a Python system, leveraging <b>OpenCV</b> and <b>Tesseract OCR</b> for live text recognition from webcam feeds.
- Deployed spaCy for sophisticated text processing and <b>tkinter</b> for a user friendly GUI, enabling instant conversion of text to Braille and increased usability by 40% by boosting accessibility for visually impaired users.

# Extra-Curricular
- Participated in HackBattle (IEEE-CS, VIT), an intense 2 day Hackathon. Built our own scripting language to maintain and extract data from different invoices. 
- Actively participated as <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AWulbWBss5SEor6m-LGqsMJWyceBk_de/view?usp=sharing"><b>Management Head</b></a>  in the Innovator's Quest Club, focusing on graphic design and management. Created event posters and organized five on-campus events.
- Implemented an Announcer Bot on the club's Discord server, enhancing communication and engagement with 100+ members.
